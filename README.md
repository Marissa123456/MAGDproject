_Lab Assignment 2_

The first file is a project from the beginning of the year, from when we first started to work with colors. I decided to create an outer space landscape, including several starts and a few planets. I originally wanted more rings for the purple planet in the bottom corner, but I was not experienced enough, so I shifted that attention to adding details on the small brown-colored planet.


_Lab Assignment 3_

This file was from when we first learned how to do mouse movements, and as a result this file is interactive. It was interesting to be working with mouse movements for the first time, and when it was complete I would play around with the mouse a bit, just to see how it responded to mosue speeds and mouse locations.


_Lab Assignment 7_

This one is a considerable shift in skillset, as it has animation and a bit of a detailed landscape. The aim was for a nature-themed project, as that was one of the prompts. I decided for a cherry blossom tree, and it was rather challenging to set up the array how I wanted to. But the project came out quite good.
